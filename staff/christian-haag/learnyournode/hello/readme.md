# LEARN YOU THE NODE.JS FOR MUCH WIN!

 ## HELLO WORLD (Exercise 1 of 13)

  Write a program that prints the text "HELLO WORLD" to the console
  (stdout).
  
 ## HINTS

  To make a Node.js program, create a new file with a .js extension and
  start writing JavaScript! Execute your program by running it with the node  
  command. e.g.:  
   
     $ node program.js  
   
  You can write to the console in the same way as in the browser:  
   
     console.log("text")
