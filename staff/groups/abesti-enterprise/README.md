## Introduction

versoLab is an app that help users to find song lyrics. It connects to Musixmatch database, which stores millions of songs in multiple languages.

Through this app user is able to register using an in-house API, log in and save its favorite lyrics. There's a third API (Musicbrainz) which has been tested OK and is able to retrieve album covers, but it wasn't implemented due schedule issues.

This project has been made with REACT and the website design has been done with SASS.
